    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>This bread is a family favorite. It is very moist, freezes well, 
        and makes a great addition to school lunches with peanut butter spread on a slice.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 very ripe bananas, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 5x9-inch loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Mash 2 bananas in a bowl with a fork. Place remaining 2 bananas in a separate bowl with 1 cup sugar and beat the bananas and sugar with an electric mixer until creamed and fluffy, 3 minutes. 
            Beat in melted butter, eggs, sour cream, and vanilla extract until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl and stir the flour mixture into banana-sugar mixture. Fold in mashed bananas and walnuts. 
            Pour batter into prepared loaf pan and tap the pan on the counter several times to remove any air pockets. Stir 2 teaspoons sugar with cinnamon in a small bowl and sprinkle the cinnamon sugar over the top of the loaf.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bread is golden brown on top and set in the center, 1 hour and 15 minutes; rotate bread pan in oven halfway through baking. 
            Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to finish cooling on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
